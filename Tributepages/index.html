                                $666.66.</li>

                            <li>1983: The Lisa computer goes on sale with much fanfare, only to be pulled two years later. Jobs
                                lures John Sculley away from Pepsico Inc. to serve as Apple's CEO.
                            </li>

                                instead of whole computers.</li>
