(The Clear Evidence)
Number of Verses: 8
Contents of the Surah
بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمنِ الرَّحِيمِ
In The Name of Allah, The Beneficent, The Merciful

The contents of the Surah attests to the fact that it was revealed in Medina, because, the People (Jews and Christians) of the Book (the Scripture) are repeatedly talked about, and we know that at the time of revelation the communication between the Muslims and the people of the Book occurred mostly in Medina.

Furthermore, the words of the Surah are both about prayers and alms. It is true that the duty of paying the alms-tax was issued in Mecca, but the act of spreading this idea with the necessary formalities, was extended in Medina.</p>

<p><iframe width="320" height="320" align="right" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jzKHG1pKPS8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>One of the ways prophets were introduced to the people was by another prophet whose prophethood had been proved with logical reasoning. The previous prophet specifically introduced the future prophet, and this introduction should be to the extent that he had destroyed all doubts towards the upcoming prophet. The prophethood of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.) was proven not only through clear logical reasoning, but also through the books of the previous prophets.
Furthermore, his name and characteristics have been clarified in the old and new testaments. Allah (SWT) in the Holy Quran narrates from Prophet Isa/Jesus (A.S.): "And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: "O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah (sent) to you, confirming the Law (which came) before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad."(2) When this verse and the like were revealed, Holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) recited them for people, and amongst them certainly groups of Jews and Christians resided in the Arabian Peninsula. Certainly if this news did not exist in their books, the scholars of these two religions would have objected immensely to this matter. However according to authentic historical references, they not only remained silent to these words, but as a matter of fact many of them became Muslims.</p>
